# 4. Key Insights

ðŸ“Œ Churn Drivers
- Top churn reasons include:
  - Competitor advantages (better devices, data, coverage)
  - Poor customer service and support
  - Pricing and technology gaps

ðŸ“Œ Contract Type Impact
- Month-to-Month contracts show the highest churn rates, especially among female customers.
- Longer contracts (One Year, Two Year) correlate with lower churn and longer tenure.

ðŸ“Œ Payment Method Influence
- Customers using Paper Checks show higher churn rates.
- Automatic payments (credit card) are associated with lower churn.
  
ðŸ“Œ Age and Group Plans
- Churn rate increases with age, possibly due to reduced  engagement with technology or changing service needs among older customers.  
- Customers not part of a group exhibit a higher churn rate, suggesting group plans may enhance retention.
	
ðŸ“Œ Data Plan & Usage
- Customers with limited data plans and lower usage (<5 GB) churn more frequently.
- Unlimited data plans reduce churn, especially among heavy users.

ðŸ“Œ Customer Service Calls
- States with low service call volumes (e.g., California) also show elevated churn rates.
- Indicates dissatisfaction or unresolved issues.
